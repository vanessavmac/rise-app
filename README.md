# rise-app
A productivity android app for creating and managing routines. Users can build multiple routines which consist of a list of tasks. When completing a routine, users can use the built in timer to help them complete their tasks and track how much time they spend.

The easy-to-use user interface helps the user create short focused tasks and write down their motivation so that they can build consistent routines.
